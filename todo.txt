Logic for lobby vs sandbox : 

When connecting, if not in sandbox, we send a packet like 'LobbyUpPacket', client will then set the clientLobbyManager.getInstance().enterLobby() 
if in sandbox mode, we will send a packet like 'SandboxUpPacket', client will then directly go into Playing state and sandbox gameModeManager.
